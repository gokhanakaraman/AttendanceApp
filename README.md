 ionic framework and cordova used during the development of the application.

 services and this function allows applications to provide periodic updates 
 for the device’s geographical location.

 > This application is an online attendance system which makes attendances easier and safely.
 Nowadays one of the problems in the schools is tracking attendance is not easy and safe. 
 Particularly in universities. Classes are crowded and not easy to manage all students in that age. 
 My purpose is to change this system to an online platform and prevent any cheating on attendance systems. This application has been developed for teachers, academicians, professors and assistants. But this application mostly addresses students.
